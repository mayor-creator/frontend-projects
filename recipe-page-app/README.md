## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

- I choose to use SASS to style recipe component since it allows me to practice and improve my knowledge of SASS

### Continued development

- How to effectively organize folder structure in SASS.
- Lessons on mixins and functions.

### Useful resources

- [Converting px to rem with Sass](https://notesontech.com/px-to-rem-with-sass/) - This helped me to understand how to write functions in SASS reason.
- [The New SASS Module System: Out with @import, In with @use](https://stefaniefluin.medium.com/the-new-sass-module-system-out-with-import-in-with-use-e1bd8ba032d0) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand how to use @use and @forward in SASS. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept and what to practice.
